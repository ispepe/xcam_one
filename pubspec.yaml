# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/2.0x/
    - assets/images/3.0x/

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For

    # fonts:
    #   - family: Schyler
